SELECT COUNT (*) FROM COUNTRIES;
SELECT MIN (percent_of_world_pop), MAX (percent_of_world_pop)
FROM COUNTRIES;

#2. Find out the average rating of fertility rate if the average is above 2.8
SELECT NAME, AVG(fertility_rate) 
from countries 
GROUP BY NAME
HAVING AVG (fertility_rate)> 2.8;

#3. Create a column that shows which country had any changed within one year by outputting “percent_one_year_change” with ‘increase, decrease, no change’. 
SELECT NAME,
  CASE
  WHEN percent_one_year_change > 1 THEN "INCREASE"
  WHEN percent_one_year_change < 1 THEN "DECREASE"
  ELSE "NO_CHANGE"
  END as "ONE_YEAR_CHANGE" FROM countries
  ORDER BY ONE_YEAR_CHANGE ASC; 
 
 #4. Extended of question above. How many countries had an increase, decrease and no change?
SELECT COUNT(NAME),
  CASE
  WHEN percent_one_year_change > 1 THEN "INCREASE"
  WHEN percent_one_year_change < 1 THEN "DECREASE"
  ELSE "NO_CHANGE"
  END as "ONE_YEAR_CHANGE" FROM countries
  GROUP BY "ONE_YEAR_CHANGE";
