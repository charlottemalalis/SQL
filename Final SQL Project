# Here are potential answers to the example questions in the final SQL project. 
# Note that there are often multiple ways to write SQL to come up with the same answer. 

#1. Find the top 5 artists with the highest total track sales (sum of the number of times their tracks were sold).
SELECT a.Name AS ArtistName, SUM(il.Quantity) AS TotalSales
FROM artists a
JOIN albums al ON a.ArtistId = al.ArtistId
JOIN tracks t ON al.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN invoice_items il ON t.TrackId = il.TrackId
GROUP BY a.Name
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
LIMIT 5;

#2. Determine the most popular genre among customers by finding the genre with the highest total sales.
SELECT g.Name AS Genre, SUM(il.Quantity) AS TotalSales
FROM genres g
JOIN tracks t ON g.GenreId = t.GenreId
JOIN invoice_items il ON t.TrackId = il.TrackId
GROUP BY g.Name
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
LIMIT 1;

#3. Identify the customer who has been inactive the longest (i.e., made their last purchase the furthest in the past).
FROM customers c
JOIN invoices i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
GROUP BY c.CustomerId
ORDER BY LastPurchaseDate ASC
LIMIT 1

#4. Calculate the average track price for each album, and list the albums along with their average track prices.
SELECT a.Title AS AlbumTitle, AVG(t.UnitPrice) AS AvgTrackPrice
FROM albums a
JOIN tracks t ON a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
GROUP BY a.AlbumId;

#5. Find the number of customers and the total sales for each year, ordered by the year of their first purchase.
SELECT
    strftime('%Y', i.InvoiceDate) AS PurchaseYear,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.CustomerId) AS NumberOfCustomers,
    SUM(i.Total) AS TotalSales
FROM customers c
JOIN invoices i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
GROUP BY PurchaseYear
ORDER BY PurchaseYear;

#6. Calculate the average invoice amount for each customer, including their name and the average amount they spend.
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, AVG(i.Total) AS AvgInvoiceAmount
FROM customers c
JOIN invoices i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
GROUP BY c.CustomerId;

#7. Compare the total spending of customers who have made their first purchase in the USA vs those who made their first purchase in another country. 
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN c.Country = 'USA' THEN 'USA'
        ELSE 'Other'
    END AS CustomerLocation,
    SUM(i.Total) AS TotalSpending
FROM customers c
JOIN invoices i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
GROUP BY CustomerLocation;
